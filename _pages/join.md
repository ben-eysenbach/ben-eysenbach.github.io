**Join the Princeton RL group!**
* **PhD & MS students**: If you're a new PhD/MS student, or an existing student in another department/group looking to collaborate (or for a co-advisor), send me an email. Otherwise, apply to the Princeton CS PhD program and mention my name in your statement. _Emailing me will not increase your probability of acceptance._
* **Undergrads**: Princeton undergrads interested in doing independent research should email me _after_ taking either my graduate RL seminar or the advanced undergraduate RL course (coming Spring 2024).
* **Postdocs**: I'm hiring 1--2 postdocs to focus on (1) large-scale unsupervised RL and (2) applications of RL to synthesis problems in science/engineering. Apply by emailing me.
* **Grant manager**: Our department is actively hiring grant managers! [Apply](https://main-princeton.icims.com/jobs/17348/grants-manager/job), even if you don't meet all the qualifications.[*](https://hbr.org/2014/08/why-women-dont-apply-for-jobs-unless-theyre-100-qualified)
* **External/visiting students**: In very rare circumstances I will work with external students. Apply by [pitching me on a project](mailto:eysenbach@princeton.edu?subject=Research%20Pitch%3A%20%24(title)&body=tldr%3A%20%24(280-character-summary)%0A*%20%24(details-in-bullets)%0A*%20%24(more-details)%0A){:target="_blank"}.

**Tips**:
I am especially interested in recruiting students/postdocs in the following areas. If applicable, mention it in your application.
1. have experience in synthesis problems in chemistry (e.g., retrosynthesis), biology (e.g., lineage tracing, trajectory inference), or other scientific disciplines;
2. have experience with large-scale computer systems; or
3. come from non-traditional/underrepresented backgrounds, including (but not limited to) students from low-income backgrounds and those who have worked for several years after their undergraduate.
