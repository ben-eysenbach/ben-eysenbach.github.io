**Join the Princeton RL group!** 

Because students from overrepresented groups are statistically more likely to apply [[1](https://hbr.org/2014/08/why-women-dont-apply-for-jobs-unless-theyre-100-qualified), [2](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.p20151114), [3](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6210.2007.00715.x)], I especially encourage prospective students/postdocs from historically underrepresented groups to reach out.

* **Pre-doctoral researcher, interns**: I currently don't have funding for these positions. For equity reasons, I don't allow unfunded/volunteer positions.
* **Visiting students**: If you are a PhD student at another University interested in visiting the RL group for some number of months, email me. In most cases, I will expect that the visit is funded by your home institution.
* **MS/PhD applicants**: I do not plan to admit PhD students for the Fall 2025 application cycle. MS admissions is handled through the [department](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/grad/admissions-requirements). Useful resources:
    * [Workshops on navigating the application process](https://engineering.princeton.edu/diversity-and-inclusion/events)
    * [Fee Waivers](https://gradschool.princeton.edu/admission-onboarding/prepare/deadlines-and-fees) are available for many students.
    * Pre-application mentoring programs can be a useful for getting feedback on your application materials, before you submit [[MIT](https://eecs-gaap.mit.edu/), [UW](https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/graduate/phd-program/phd-admissions/pams/)].
* **Incoming Princeton PhD & MS students**: If you're an existing Princeton MS/PhD student interested in working together, send me an email.
* **Princeton Undergrads**: If interested in independent research, email me _after_ taking either my graduate RL seminar or the undergraduate RL course.
* **Postdocs**: I am especially interested in working with a postdoc on (1) large-scale unsupervised RL, (2) connections between unsupervised RL (e.g., contrastive representations) and neuroscience (e.g., grid cells), and (3) applications of RL to synthesis problems in science/engineering. I do not currently have funding for a postdoc, so applicants are expected to secure a postdoc fellowship (e.g., [Princeton Presidential Fellowship](https://dof.princeton.edu/diversity-and-inclusion/talent-pathway-programs/presidential-postdoctoral-research-fellows), the [CSML Postdoc Fellowship](https://csml.princeton.edu/news/postdoctoral-research-associate), the [PLI Postdoc Fellowship](https://pli.princeton.edu/people/postdoctoral-researchers)). Apply by emailing me, including a resume, a few paragraphs about what you'd like to work on, and what fellowship[s] you plan to apply to (I can usually write a letter of support for these).
* **High school students**: I don't work with high school students. Check out [Princeton AI4All](https://ai4all.princeton.edu/).

**Tips**:
* I am especially interested in recruiting students/postdocs with experience in (1) neuroscience + RL, (2) applications of control/planning/RL to science/engineering, or (3) large-scale GPU training.
* In your application, demonstrate that you understand the sorts of research that we're doing (e.g., check our a recent talk or paper).
