**Join the Princeton RL group!** 

* **Postdocs**: I am especially interested in working with a postdoc on (1) large-scale unsupervised RL, (2) connections between unsupervised RL (e.g., contrastive representations) and neuroscience (e.g., grid cells), and (3) applications of RL to synthesis problems in science/engineering.  Apply by emailing me, including a resume and a few paragraphs about what you'd like to work on.
* **Visiting students**: If you are a PhD student at another University interested in visiting the RL group for some number of months, email me. In most cases, I will expect that the visit is funded by your home institution.
* **MS/PhD applicants**: I do not plan to admit PhD students for the Fall 2025 application cycle. MS admissions is handled through the [department](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/grad/admissions-requirements). Useful resources:
    * [Workshops on navigating the application process](https://engineering.princeton.edu/diversity-and-inclusion/events)
    * [Fee Waivers](https://gradschool.princeton.edu/admission-onboarding/prepare/deadlines-and-fees) are available for many students.
    * Pre-application mentoring programs can be a useful for getting feedback on your application materials, before you submit [[MIT](https://eecs-gaap.mit.edu/), [UW](https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/graduate/phd-program/phd-admissions/pams/)].
* **Incoming Princeton PhD & MS students**: If you're an existing Princeton MS/PhD student interested in working together, send me an email.
* **Princeton Undergrads**: If interested in independent research, email me _after_ taking either my graduate RL seminar or the undergraduate RL course.
* **High school students**: I don't work with high school students. Check out [Princeton AI4All](https://ai4all.princeton.edu/).

**Tips**:
* I am especially interested in recruiting students/postdocs with experience in (1) neuroscience + RL, (2) applications of control/planning/RL to science/engineering, or (3) large-scale GPU training.
* In your application, demonstrate that you understand the sorts of research that we're doing (e.g., check our a recent talk or paper).
