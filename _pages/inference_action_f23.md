<center><h1>COS 597R: Inference in Action:</h1>
<h2>Probabilistic Topics in Reinforcement Learning</h2>
<p>Fall 2023</p>
<p>Monday and Wednesday, 1:30pm -- 2:50pm</p>
</center>

**Instructor**: [Benjamin Eysenbach](./about.md)

**Description**: Reinforcement learning (RL) is about using machine learning to not just mimic past predictions, but instead to determine which decisions will lead to good, long-term outcomes. While RL is typically viewed and taught from the perspectives of control theory and stochastic optimization, this course will study RL through the lens of probabilistic inference. This perspective will provide new ways of thinking about RL methods and suggest how to build new RL methods using techniques from other areas of machine learning (e.g., self-supervised learning). The course will be split between interactive lectures and discussions of recent papers.

This course is primarily intended for PhD students studying topics related to reinforcement learning and probabilistic inference. That said, the course is open to any students who excelled in CS 324. 

**Prerequisites**: C0S 324. Additional familiarity with reinforcement learning (RL) and probabilistic inference will help, but we will spend the first few classes reviewing these topics. We will regularly make use of calculus, probability, and linear algebra.

**Office hours**: Wednesday 3pm – 4pm in CS 416

**Structure and Grading**: Grading will be done in an additive fashion. With a few exceptions (details below), each of the 24 classes will be worth 5 points, and the lowest 4 class grades will be dropped. There will not be late days for the graded components of standard class periods; as implied by the previous sentence, 4 of these can be skipped without penalty. For the projects (details below), late days will only be granted in extenuating circumstances.

_Reflections (2 points)_: This will be largely a discussion-based class, so it will be important to engage with the material before coming to class. To support this, students will write a short 2 – 3 paragraph summary/reflection on the reading material.  This reflection ideally be as short and descriptive as possible (E.g., "This paper combines X with Y. The exception is that Z is used. It's surprising that A works because B found C." ). Some questions to think about when writing:
* Why is this paper important?
* Ideas for new research?
* How does it relate to things you've studied or researched previously?
* How does it relate to the material from past weeks?
* How might it be applied to various applications?
* What confused/excited you about the material?

This reflection should be posted on the course Slack channel before sunrise on the day of the class. These reflections are not an exercise in whether you can effectively summarize a paper or copy-paste its list of contributions. Rather, the aim is to think critically about how this paper relates to other papers. It's really a contextual summary, one that will be different for different students (you all have different backgrounds), and hence will be interesting for other students to read (in the hours between sunrise and the afternoon class).
Slack Comments (1 point): Post a comment on someone else's reflection on Slack. This could be answering a question asked in their reflection, emphasizing a point they made, bringing up some connections between their ideas and yours. I think you'll get the most out of this if you do it in a timely fashion, commenting on material right before/after it is discussed in class. The deadline for the week is Friday at sunset.

_In-class discussions (2 points)_: I expect students to actively participate in the discussions in class. In most classes, two students will jointly lead the discussion. These leaders will not be required to post a reflection on slack comments for that class, and will be graded solely based on the in-class discussion (5 points).

_Projects (2 x 12 points)_: At two points in the semester, students will write a "research proposal," which will resemble the first half of an academic conference paper: Introduction, Related Work, and Proposed Method. The introduction is important for explaining the problem and why it is important. The related work should contextualize your proposed project, relating it to some of the ideas discussed in the course.  The method section should be technically correct and complete. It should not be obviously the same as prior work. But, it's fine if it's a re-interpretation of prior work. Taken together, this research proposal should demonstrate that you've understood and engaged with the course material. Structurally, these two projects will resemble a proposal you'd submit to PhD fellowship programs.

Each project will last 3 class periods and will be graded out of 12 points. For these three class periods, there will be no required reflections or slack comments, and the discussion will count 1 point (so the 3 class periods sum to 15 points).
