My research aims to develop principled <b>reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms</b> that obtain
state-of-the-art performance with a higher degree of simplicity, scalability, and robustness than current
methods. Much of my work uses ideas for probabilistic inference to make progress on a important problems in RL (e.g., long-horizon and high-dimensional reasoning, robustness, exploration).

**Bio:** I did my PhD in machine learning at CMU, advised by [Ruslan Salakhutdinov](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/) and [Sergey Levine](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~svlevine/) and supported by the NSF GFRP and the Hertz Fellowship. I spent a number of years at [Google Brain/Research](https://research.google/) before and during my PhD.

**Join us!** I am hiring new students at all levels, a postdoc, and a grant manager. [Read this](./hiring) before emailing me.
