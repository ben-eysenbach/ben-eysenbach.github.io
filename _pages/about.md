I run the <a href="https://princeton-rl.github.io/">Princeton Reinforcement Learning Lab</a>, where we study the science of intelligent decision making. How can AI systems learn to explore the world and uncover previously-unknown skills or knowledge? Can agents learn about the structure of the world, about the texture of time?  How much of this learning can be done in an unsupervised fashion?

We answer these and similar questions by designing AI algorithms. While we might refer to these as ``reinforcement learning'' methods, many do not use rewards at all; exploration and learning are instead driven by (often much richer) intrinsic feedback.
Our group has developed some of the foremost algorithms and analysis for such self-supervised control methods. [Here](https://sites.google.com/view/diayn/) [are](https://graliuce.github.io/sgcrl/) a few example papers;
[here](https://ben-eysenbach.github.io/self-supervised-rl/) and [here](https://generative-rl-tutorial.github.io/) are some tutorials to learn more about our research.

My work has been recognized by a NeurIPS Best Paper Award, an NSF CAREER Award, a Hertz Fellowship, an NSF GRFP Fellowship, the Alfred Rheinstein Faculty Award, as well as recognition for Outstanding Teaching.
Before joining Princeton, I did by PhD in machine learning at CMU under [Ruslan Salakhutdinov](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/) and [Sergey Levine](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~svlevine/). I spent a number of years at [Google Brain/Research](https://research.google/) before and during my PhD. My undergraduate studies were in math at MIT.

**Come do science with us!** Check out [this page](./hiring) for details on how to get involved in the research, whether as an undergrad, PhD student, postdoc, visiting student, or external collaborator.
