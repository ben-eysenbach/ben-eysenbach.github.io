I design reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms: AI methods that learn how to make intelligent decisions from trial and error. I am especially interested in self-supervised methods, which enable agents to learn intelligent behaviors without labels or human supervision. Our group has developed some of the foremost algorithms and analysis for such self-supervised RL methods. [Here](https://sites.google.com/view/diayn/) [are](https://graliuce.github.io/sgcrl/) a few examples. I run the <a href="https://princeton-rl.github.io/">Princeton Reinforcement Learning Lab</a>.

**Bio:** Before joining Princeton, I did by PhD in machine learning at CMU under [Ruslan Salakhutdinov](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/) and [Sergey Levine](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~svlevine/) and supported by the NSF GFRP and the Hertz Fellowship. I spent a number of years at [Google Brain/Research](https://research.google/) before and during my PhD. My undergraduate studies were in math at MIT.
