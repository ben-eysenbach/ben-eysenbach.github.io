My research aims to develop principled <b>reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms</b> that obtain
state-of-the-art performance with a higher degree of simplicity, scalability, and robustness than current
methods. Much of my work uses ideas for probabilistic inference to make progress on a important problems in RL (e.g., long-horizon and high-dimensional reasoning, robustness, exploration).

**Bio:** I did my PhD in machine learning at CMU, advised by [Ruslan Salakhutdinov](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/) and [Sergey Levine](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~svlevine/) and supported by the NSF GFRP and the Hertz Fellowship. I spent a number of years at [Google Brain/Research](https://research.google/) before and during my PhD.

**Prospective students:** I am always looking for fantastic students to join the group. I am especially interested in recruiting students who
1. have previously worked in chemistry/biology/etc;
2. have experience with large-scale computer systems; or
3. come from non-traditional/underrepresented backgrounds.

If you are a current Princeton student, email me. If not, please consider applying to the Princeton CS PhD or MS programs. In rare instances I will work with external students ([pitch me!](mailto:eysenbach@princeton.edu?subject=Research%20Pitch%3A%20%24(title)&body=tldr%3A%20%24(280-character-summary)%0A*%20%24(details-in-bullets)%0A*%20%24(more-details)%0A){:target="_blank"}).
