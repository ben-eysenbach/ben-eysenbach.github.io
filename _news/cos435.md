:apple: I'm teaching [Introduction to Reinforcement Learning](https://ben-eysenbach.github.io/intro-rl/) this Spring, together with a fantastic team of TAs. I create this course to give students a strong foundation in RL and highlight that unifying themes (RL isn't just a bag of tricks). All course notes and assignments will be posted publicly, so you can follow along!
